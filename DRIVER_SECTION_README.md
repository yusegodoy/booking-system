## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend-admin
npm install
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Run the driver seeding script
npm run seed-drivers
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ..
npm install
```

### 4. Environment Variables
Make sure to set up the following environment variables:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/booking-admin
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
```

## Usage

### Admin Portal
1. Access the admin portal
2. Navigate to the "Drivers" tab
3. Use the interface to manage drivers:
   - Add new drivers
   - Edit existing driver information
   - Manage availability and status
   - Assign vehicles
   - View statistics and performance

### Driver Dashboard
1. Drivers can access their personal dashboard
2. Toggle availability status
3. Update location using GPS
4. View assigned bookings

6. Manage schedule preferences

## Sample Data

The seeding script creates 5 sample drivers with realistic data:
- John Smith (Active, Available)
- Sarah Johnson (Active, Available)
- Robert Williams (Active, Unavailable)
- Maria Garcia (Active, Available)
- David Brown (Inactive, Unavailable)

## Security Features

- **Password hashing** using bcrypt
- **JWT authentication** for secure access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Driver not appearing in list**
   - Check if driver is marked as active
   - Verify database connection
   - Check for any validation errors

2. **Location updates not working**
   - Ensure browser has location permissions
   - Check Google Maps API key configuration
   - Verify GPS is enabled on device

3. **Authentication issues**
   - Verify JWT token is valid
   - Check token expiration
   - Ensure correct credentials

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check driver data in database
npm run seed-drivers

# View server logs
npm run dev

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:5001/api/drivers
```
